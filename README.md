## My favorite Series

### **Violet Evergarden.**

1. The animation for each episode, the graphics, the art, everything is beautiful and pleasing to see.
2. The story of each episode is different every time, even though it follows the main protagonist. Nevertheless, each episode is pact with different kinds of people with their own stories that convey a heart wrenching meaning to the viewer.
3. The music in the series also amazing, it fits the mood of a scene during the episode, and it's just plain pleasing to hear.
